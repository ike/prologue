     1. THE HIEROMARTYR IGNATIUS THE GOD-BEARER
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   This holy man is called "the God-bearer'' because he constantly bore the name of the Living God in his heart and on his lips. According to tradition, he was thus named because he was held in the arms of God Incarnate, Jesus Christ. On a day when the Lord was teaching His disciples humility, He took a child and placed him among them, saying:
   <em>
    Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
   </em>
   <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
    (Matthew 18:4)
   </span>
   . This child was Ignatius. Later, Ignatius was a disciple of St. John the Theologian, together with Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna. As Bishop of Antioch, Ignatius governed the Church of God as a good shepherd and was the first to introduce antiphonal chanting in the Church, in which two choirs alternate the chanting. This manner of chanting was revealed to St. Ignatius by the angels in heaven. When Emperor Trajan was passing through Antioch on his way to do battle with the Persians, he heard of Ignatius, summoned him and counseled him to offer sacrifice to the idols. If Ignatius would do so, Trajan would bestow upon him the rank of senator. As the counsels and threats of the emperor were in vain, St. Ignatius was shackled in irons and sent to Rome in the company of ten merciless soldiers, to be thrown to the wild beasts. Ignatius rejoiced in suffering for his Lord, only praying to God that the wild beasts would become the tomb for his body and that no one would prevent him from this death. After a long and difficult journey from Asia through Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus, Ignatius arrived in Rome, where he was thrown to the lions in the circus. The lions tore him to pieces and devoured him, leaving only several of the larger bones and his heart. This glorious lover of the Lord Christ suffered in the year 106 A.D. in Rome at the time of the Christ-hating Emperor Trajan. Ignatius has appeared many times from the other world and worked miracles, even to this day helping all who call upon him for help.

    O Hierarch of Christ, wonderful and exemplary,
    <br/>
    O gracious Hierarch, not an adversary of God,
    <br/>
    Not from among the opponents of God, who killed Christ,
    <br/>
    But from among the God-bearers, who loved Christ--
    <br/>
    Holy Ignatius, God-bearing man,
    <br/>
    You do we glorify; of you we are proud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Emperor Trajan offered you titles and honors,
    <br/>
    If only you would bow down before the idols.
    <br/>
    You amazed the emperor, for you did not consent
    <br/>
    To betray the Lord, not for the entire kingdom.
    <br/>
    Instead, you went joyfully to death, O God-bearing Father;
    <br/>
    For that we glorify you; of you we are proud.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thrown before wild beasts, quietly you wait.
    <br/>
    Rome seeks amusement; they toy with you!
    <br/>
    "I am God's wheat!" you exclaimed there.
    <br/>
    "The beasts shall grind me, to become good bread!"
    <br/>
    And now, where is Trajan? But you are an inhabitant of heaven.
    <br/>
    You are a hymn to the angels, and to us a teacher.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Holy Ignatius, you who bore God,
    <br/>
    Entreat God to grant us the Bread of Life!

    The holy martyrs, seized with the love of Christ, were like unquenchable flames. This love eased their sufferings and made their deaths sweet. St. Chrysostom says of St. Ignatius: "He put off his body with as much ease as one takes off his clothes." Traveling to Rome to his death, Ignatius feared only one thing: that Christians would somehow prevent his martyrdom for Christ, by their prayers to God or in some outward manner. Therefore he continually implored them, in writing and in speech, not to do this. "Forgive me," he said. "I know what is for my benefit. I but begin to be a disciple of Christ when I desire nothing, either visible or invisible, save to attain Christ. May every diabolical torture come upon me: fire, crucifixion, wild beasts, the sword, tearing asunder, the crushing of my bones, and the dismemberment of my whole body--only that I may receive Jesus Christ. It is better for me to die for Christ than to reign to the ends of the earth…. My love is nailed to the Cross, and there is no fire of love in me for any earthly thing." When he was brought to the circus, he turned to the people with these words: "Citizens of Rome, know that I am not being punished for any crime, neither have I been condemned to death for any transgression, but rather for the sake of my God, by Whose love I am overcome and Whom I insatiably desire. I am His wheat, and the teeth of the wild beasts will grind me to be His pure bread." When he had been devoured by the wild beasts, by God's providence his heart remained among the bones. When the unbelievers cut open the saint's heart, they saw inside, inscribed in golden letters, the name Jesus Christ.

        King David sinned against God and repented, and God forgave him. The king's sin was great, but greater still was his repentance. He was guilty before God of two grave sins: adultery and murder. But when Nathan the prophet of God denounced him, he cried out in anguish:
        <em>
         I have sinned against the Lord!
        </em>
        Thus he confessed his sin and repented bitterly, most bitterly. Grief-stricken, he prayed to God, weeping, fasting, lying on the ground, and enduring meekly the terrible blows that God sent upon him, his house and his people because of his sins. In his penitential Psalms he says:
        <em>
         I am a worm and not a man
        </em>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
         (Psalm 22:6)
        </span>
        ;
        <em>
         Because of the sound of my groaning, my bones cling to my flesh
        </em>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
         (Psalm 102:5)
        </span>
        ;
        <em>
         I lie awake … for I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping
        </em>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
         (Psalm 102:7, 9)
        </span>
        ;
        <em>
         My knees are grown weak through fasting
        </em>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
         (Psalm 109:24)
        </span>
        . Here is true repentance; here is a true penitent! He did not become hardened in sin nor did he fall into despair, but, hoping in the mercy of God, he repented unceasingly. And God, Who loves the penitent, showed mercy upon this model of penitence. God forgave him and glorified him above all the kings of Israel; He gave him the great grace to compose the most beautiful penitential prayers and to prophesy the coming into the world of the Holy Savior, Who would be of his seed. Brethren, do you see how wonderful is God's mercy toward penitents? So much mercy did God have on this repentant David that He was not ashamed to take upon Himself flesh from David's seed. Blessed are they who do not become hardened in sin and who do not fall into despair because of sin. Repentance saves both the one and the other from evil.
