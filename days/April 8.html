They beat him over the head with rods; they struck him on the mouth with stones and stabbed him with knives. After they left him for dead, St. Herodian arose and continued to serve the apostles. He assisted the Apostle Peter in Rome and was beheaded, along with many other Christians, on the same day that St. Peter was crucified.

   </em>

    REFLECTION
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   There is heroism above heroism and asceticism above asceticism. St. Epiphanius of Cyprus invited Hilarion the Great to dinner and, in order to show the greatest hospitality to his distinguished guest, set roasted chicken on the table and offered it to him. Hilarion said to him: "Forgive me, but ever since I was tonsured a monk, I have eaten nothing butchered." To this Epiphanius replied: "And I, ever since I was tonsured a monk, have never lay down in bed until I first forgave my enemy." Amazed, Hilarion said: "Your virtue is greater than mine, O holy master!" This is a great lesson for all of us. Fasting is an admirable thing, but it is more admirable to forgive insults. Through fasting a man is preparing for charity, but by forgiving insults a man shows charity. Fasting precedes forgiveness, but fasting alone does not save without forgiveness.

  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
   <span class="article-text">
    "But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?'"
    <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
     (1 Corinthians 15:35)
    </span>
    .

  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   The Apostle Paul knows in advance the objections that the unbelievers will make concerning the resurrection from the dead, and he rejects them in advance. Even today, the non-believers--who have not seen with physical eyes the miracle of the resurrection in nature, much less the spiritual resurrection--ask: "How will the dead be raised?"
   <em>
    Thou fool!
   </em>
   continues the apostle,
   <em>
    that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die
   </em>
   <span style="font-size: 10pt;">
    (1 Corinthians 15:36)
   </span>
   . Unless the seed dies in the ground, the plant will not grow; in other words, something totally different from the seed will sprout up. The unbelievers see through their eyes yet do not see, but ask: "How will a dead man resurrect?" How? In the same way that Christ resurrected. He went down lifeless into the tomb, and rose alive. Even nature manifests resurrection from the dead; but more strongly than nature, it is manifested by the resurrected Lord. In order to make it easier for us to believe and to hope--to believe in the resurrection in general and to have hope in our own resurrection--He Himself resurrected from the grave and, prior to that, resurrected Lazarus the four-days-dead, the son of the widow of Nain, and the daughter of Jarius.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   The unbelievers ask: "With what kind of body will the dead rise?" In whatever kind of body God wills. With God there are many kinds of bodies. The Apostle Paul divides all bodies into two groups: earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. Therefore, they who have died in earthly bodies will be clothed with heavenly bodies: the incorruptible will replace the corruptible; the immortal will replace the mortal; the beautiful will replace the ugly. In the heavenly body, man will also recognize himself and others around him, just as man recognizes himself both when he is clothed in beggar's rags and when he is clothed in royal purple.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   Lord, Most-rich, do not give us over to eternal corruption but clothe us as royal sons in the garment of immortality.

  <strong>
   To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
