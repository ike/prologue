   Theodore was a miracle-worker. Purifying his spirit through a long life of asceticism in the wilderness of Jordan, Theodore received from God the gift of working miracles. Traveling by boat to Constantinople, it happened that the boat wandered off course and they ran out of drinking water. All the travelers on the boat were at the point of death from thirst. Theodore raised his hands to heaven, prayed to God and traced the sign of the Cross over the sea water. After that, he told the boatmen to draw water from the sea and drink. When they drank it, the water was sweet. When they all began to bow down before Theodore, he beseeched them not to thank him but to thank the

   Igor was the Prince of Chernigov and Kiev. Persecuted by his kinsmen, he withdrew from the world and was tonsured a monk. The inhabitants of Kiev, dissatisfied with the Olgovitch dynasty, wanted to exterminate it. They charged the monastery, captured the young and innocent Schemamonk Igor and slew him. Many were the misfortunes that befell the inhabitants of Kiev as a result of this crime. But over the grave of this blessed monk candles were seen to light by themselves on several occasions, and a fiery pillar was seen over the church where he was buried. This occurred in the year 1147 A.D.

     6. BLESSED CONSTANTINE, METROPOLITAN OF KIEV
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="article-text">
   In the days of Blessed Prince Igor, when there was great quarreling and confusion among the Russian princes, there was also disorder in the Church and frequent changes on the thrones of the hierarchs. Thus, after the death of Metropolitan Michael of Kiev, Prince Izyaslav brought in the famous and learned monk Klim as metropolitan without seeking the blessing of the patriarch of Constantinople, contrary to the age-old tradition. The patriarch sent Metropolitan Constantine to investigate the matter. Constantine removed Klim and deposed all those clerics that he had ordained. Because of this the people were divided: some adhered to Klim and others adhered to Constantine. Then, according to the wishes of the Russian princes, the patriarch sent a third, Theodore, and both Klim and Constantine were removed. When Constantine died, in the year 1159 A.D. they opened his will, and in it he had requested that he not be buried but that his body be thrown in a field to be consumed by dogs, because he considered himself to have been the culprit responsible for the confusion in the Church. Not daring to disobey his testament, but nevertheless with great fear, men took the body of the metropolitan and threw it into a field, where it lay for three days. For three days there was a terrible thunder over Kiev, lightening flashed all around and struck, and the earth quaked. Eight men perished from the lightning. Three fiery pillars appeared over Constantine's lifeless body. Seeing all of this, the prince of Kiev ordered that the body of Constantine be taken and honorably buried in the church where the tomb of Igor was located. Immediately afterward a calm ensued in nature. Thus God justified His humble servant.

  Do not ever violate the fast on Wednesday and Friday. This fast is commanded by the Church and is well founded. If you have ever in your life violated this fast, pray to God that He forgive you, and sin no more. Pious men do not consider themselves exempt from this fast when traveling, or even in sickness. St. Pachomius met some men carrying a corpse and he saw two angels in the funeral procession. He prayed to God to reveal to him the mystery of the presence of the angels at the burial of this man. What good did this man do that the holy angels of God accompanied him in procession to the grave? According to God's providence, both angels approached Pachomius and explained this to him: "One of us is the angel of Wednesday and the other is the angel of Friday. Seeing how this man always, even until death, fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays, we are honorably accompanying his body. As he kept the fast until death, so are we glorifying him."
