     1. THE HIEROMARTYR

      [PRIEST-MARTYR]
     </span>
     BASIL, BISHOP OF AMASEA

  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   Licinius, brother-in-law of Constantine, to whose sister he was married, pretended to be a Christian before the great emperor. When he received authority from the emperor to govern the entire East, he began, at first secretly and later openly, to persecute the Christians and to strengthen idolatry. His wife grieved much over this, but she was unable to dissuade her husband from this shamefulness. Giving himself over to idolatry, Licinius also gave himself up to all the passions without restraint but, most of all, to brutality toward women. Under the assault of these unclean passions, Licinius wanted to defile the virgin Glaphyra, who was in the service of the empress. Glaphyra complained to the empress, and the empress secretly sent her away from the imperial court of Nicomedia to the province of Pontus. Glaphyra arrived at the town of Amasea and was cordially received by Bishop Basil and other Christians. Glaphyra was elated that God had saved her virginity, and she wrote to the empress concerning this. The empress also rejoiced and she forwarded money to the church in Amasea. However, a letter of Glaphyra's, which was directed to the empress, fell into the hands of the emperor's eunuch, who showed it to Licinius. The emperor, learning where Glaphyra was staying, immediately ordered that she and the bishop be brought back to Nicomedia. In the meantime Glaphyra died, and the soldiers brought Basil back to Nicomedia, alone and bound. Following tortures and imprisonment, this blessed man was beheaded and thrown into the sea, in the year 322 A.D. Through a vision of an angel of God, his clergy found his body near the town of Sinope. They removed his body from the water with the aid of a fisherman's net and translated it to Amasea, where they honorably buried it in the church which he, by his efforts, had built. The Emperor Constantine raised up an army against Licinius, defeated him, captured him, and exiled him to Gaul, where he ended his God-hating life.

    3. SAINT STEPHEN, BISHOP OF PERM
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   Stephen was a Russian by birth. From an early age he was devoted to prayer and divine contemplation. As a young man, Stephen went to Rostov, where he was tonsured a monk in the Monastery of St. Gregory the Theologian. Learning about the land of Perm, which was completely overrun with the weeds of paganism, Stephen desired to become a missionary in this land.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="article-text">
   He immediately dedicated himself to studying the language of Perm, and when he had mastered the language, he composed an alphabet and translated the ecclesiastical books into that language. With the blessing of the Metropolitan of Moscow, Stephen, as a presbyter, started out on his apostolic mission and began to preach the Gospel with apostolic zeal in the dense darkness of the paganism of Perm. Having baptized a few souls, he endeavored to build a church in Perm dedicated to the Holy Annunciation. When the Church of God flourished in Perm, he was consecrated as its bishop. Undergoing every hardship, affliction, malice and humiliation, he succeeded in dispelling the darkness among the heathens of Perm and in illuminating them with the Light of Christ. In his old age he returned to Moscow once more, and there he ended his earthly life and took up his habitation with the Lord in the year 1396 AD.

 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  The emperor's tribune says to Basil:
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  "Listen, old man, the emperor Licinius, protector of the gods,
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">

  If you do not, an evil death awaits you."
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  Basil shines with joy,
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  And to the tribune he wonderfully responds:
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  "Go tell your wicked emperor:
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  If you gave me even your entire kingdom,
 </p>
 <p class="article-text" style="text-align: center;">
  But took away my resurrected Christ,

   Christ is not light and darkness, but only light. Christ is not truth and falsehood, but only truth. Nor is Christ life and death; He is only life. Nor is He strength and weakness; He is only strength. Nor is He love and hate; He is only love. He is the "yea" for every good, and in Him there is no vacillating between "yea" and "nay." His teaching is all-pure, all-true, all-light and all-loving toward mankind. His path is accurately hewn and He does not permit swerving either to the left or to the right. Not even a shadow of sin can pass over His teaching or find a place on His path. His Person is the incarnation of goodness; all that is good is in Him, and all that is sinful, false, malicious and unjust is outside of Him.
